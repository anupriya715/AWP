<p>Anchor text — or link text — is the visible, 
clickable text of a link. It usually appears 
in a different color than the surrounding text 
and is often underlined. Good link text tells 
the reader what to expect if they click on the link
What is anchor text example?
Anchor text is "exact match" 
if it includes a keyword that mirrors the page that 
is being linked to. For example: 'link building' 
linking to a page about link building.</p>
